[[{"i":"whats-chiefonboarding","l":"What's ChiefOnboarding?","p":["In one sentence, ChiefOnboarding is an open-source remote-first employee onboarding platform that helps you streamline the employee experience for both the new hire and you through Slack or the web portal.","With ChiefOnboarding you can create generic new hire timelines and apply them to specific new hires. Timelines are designed in a way that it will reduce the overwhelming feeling that a new hire often gets on their first few days and increases overall quality due to consistency.","Let's start at the beginning. Your new hire just said: \"Yeah! I want to work for you\" and you both signed the contracts. Up next, you need to make sure that your new hire knows things like the dress code, when they should start and what to expect from their first few days. That's often called pre-boarding.","With our pre-boarding module, you can create several pages with information, pictures, files, lists and so on with everything that your new hire needs to know. You can even add custom forms that will allow you to get some information from your new hire before they start. How about asking them for their favorite snack and adding that to their goodie pack to surprise them?","Oh... but someone needs to make that goodie pack, right? That's why we created our \"tasks\" module. In the timeline you can add tasks for your colleagues. Those are automatically created and colleagues will be notified of them. Colleagues are able to leave comments and check them off. They can even collaborate with others on a shared task.","In the meantime, our Slack bot will send your team a message letting them know that someone is starting very soon. Your colleagues will be able to leave a custom welcome message, which will show up in the new hire's preboarding pages. Talking about keeping it personal!","It's a few days before the new hire starts. It's probably a good idea to give the buddy and manager a quick heads-up about the new hire starting soon - better be safe than sorry. Add a custom Slack/Email/Text message in the timeline so they will be reminded on time.","Oh no, you still need to set up their user accounts (Slack, Google, Asana etc) to give them access to the things they will need. Your IT department is already clocking in overtime... Our account provisioning module will take care of that for you! Add the integrations to your timeline on the day you want and let the platform create the accounts for them.","It's the new hire's first day and your new hire gets to meet a lot of people in your Slack team. To avoid any awkward conversations, your new hire can look into the colleagues directory to see who does what. Even better yet, you can send colleague introductions directly to your new hire. This is great for introducing their direct coworkers.","There are some tasks that every new hire needs to complete, right? You can easily create those todo items and follow up on those or remind them if they are late on one (this can also be automated by the way). Got a quick assessment for them to complete? Throw it in a to do item and have them complete it!","Adding too many to do items could be a bit demotivating. Especially if they are mostly boring things that just need to get done. You can obviously spread them over the first few days/weeks, but that might not be enough. We hear you... How about rewarding them with a badge? Throw a condition in the timeline that waits for a few to do items to be completed and then sends them a custom message with a reward. As easy as that.","Over the next few weeks, they will have to learn a lot of things. General things like how to request a holiday or how to collect their paycheck come to mind. With our \"Resources\" module, you can easily create small wiki's with all the information they need. You can let them go through the resource by themselves, or convert it to a course to validate that they actually read through it all with questionaires.","Those timelines are extremely flexible. We understand that every company is different and that you need a custom approach to your onboarding plan."]},{"l":"Privacy","p":["We care about your privacy. ChiefOnboarding does not contain any weird or creepy trackers and you can even host it on your own servers if you really want full control over it. You might find that some of the integrations require quite a lot of permissions from a third party. That kind of info is stored in encrypted fields and I want to emphasise that ChiefOnboarding does not ping home, ever! We will never receive any information from your server.","We can collect error logs for users who use our servers. This will ensure quick bug fixes and therefore improve stability of the platform. This is always on an opt-in basis - it's disabled by default and we ask for permission."]},{"l":"Support","p":["Over the past 1,5 years (Sept 2020 - August 2022), we have had an average response time to questions of 1 hour and an average response time of 2 hours for bug fixes (actually fixing the bug, not just acknowledging the bug report). While those aren't official SLAs, we do our best to keep those averages as low as they are. Email support is only part of our paid plans, users hosting their own copy will have to fallback to Github issues (and it takes more time to get back to you - paying customers are always in the priority queue). With the support and managed package, you get the best of both worlds: the transparancy of open source software with the fast support of a premium software package.","Helpful links:","ChiefOnboarding repo: https://github.com/chiefonboarding/ChiefOnboarding","Pricing: https://chiefonboarding.com/pricing"]}],[{"i":"how-to--demo","l":"How to / Demo","p":["At ChiefOnboarding, we currently don't do demos with potential customers. Demos take a lot of time and are quite similar between potential customers. You all come with the same goal, right? Improving your onboarding process.","Underneath, you will basically find the transcript of a demo. You will get to see most of the features that our software provides and you can easily come back to it, if you want to look something up again. At the same time, we can keep working on features that you want.","As always: if you have a question, feel free to send us an email- we are fast at replying (often within an hour)."]},{"l":"Sequences","p":["At ChiefOnboarding, we base everything around sequences. Sequences are basically timelines which will map out the new hire's onboarding path. It looks like this:","Let's break it down a bit:","Sequences consist of blocks. We currently have 3 types of blocks:","General blocks","Block before the new hire starts","Block after the new hire has started","Block based on the completion of a to do item","Unconditioned block"]},{"l":"The general blocks","p":["There are three types of general blocks that you can choose from. You can create a block that triggers before the new hire starts. You could use this to create tasks (we will get to this later) for colleagues for things they need to do or send some emails/slack/text messages.","The second type of general blocks are the ones that start after the new hire starts. These are marked in workdays, so it doesn't really matter if your new hire starts on a Monday or Thursday - ChiefOnboarding will skip the weekends and not bother the new hire on those days. Example: Monday is workday 1, next week Monday is then day 6. You can add a bunch more in these types of blocks (which we will get into in a bit). We will notify the new hire of any newly added things - you can disable this if you don't want that.","All of the above blocks trigger at 8 AM in the new hire's timezone. Yes, ChiefOnboarding is totally remote friendly, we support multiple time zones and multiple languages.","The third type of general block is a special one. You can have things happen based on a to do item. We will get into to do items in a bit, but basically what this means is that you can wait for your new hire to complete a to do item and then it will trigger to create a new to do item for the new hire or perhaps send a message to a colleague. The possibilities are endless."]},{"l":"The unconditioned block","p":["You can only add one of these and you can add things in here that are automatically added to the new hire when you add the sequence to your new hire. You could add some random stuff in here that your new hire might need or that they need right from the start. Think of some policies and some default to do items.","Also often used to add preboarding pages that your new hire will be able to see BEFORE they join the company. A pre-boarding page basically looks like this:","preboarding edit","And you can preview it with the preview button, it will look like this:","preboarding view","You might have noticed the little part at the bottom that says \"Form options\". You can actually build a custom form where you can allow your new hire to send some information back to you. Perhaps you want to know what their favorite snack is."]},{"l":"Templates","p":["So what could we put in these blocks? We have created a few different types of templates that you could add in these. You could create those templates before you start to create the sequence, but you can also just add items as you go."]},{"l":"To do items","p":["To do items look like this (for you):","todo edit","Let's break it down a bit more.","I think the title speaks for itself: it will be displayed to the new hire with that.","The Due on workday field will allow you to add a workday on when the tasks needs to be completed. New hire's will get a notification of that in Slack/Webportal. Remember: this is workdays, not calendar days. If Monday is day 1, then next week Monday is day 6!","Then we have the Tags part. This is just a means of identification for yourself and other staff members. Totally optionally, but just something for you to separate tasks that have the same name. New hires will never get to see the tags.","The content is basically a WYSIWYG editor that allows you to add various things. Such as headers, lists, files and images. You can even create forms in these if you would like to get some info back from the new hire.","At the very bottom, you have a quick check box (only available with Slack integration), which is currently checked. This means that the answers from the new hire will be sent back to the Slack channel that you specify there. It's best to make the new hire aware of this, so they don't add anything they wouldn't want to share with the rest of the team. This feature is perfect for when you want to let your new hire introduce to the team with a default format."]},{"l":"Resource items","p":["Resource items are meant to inform your new hire. Think of general procedures, how to use specific tools etc. Resources look like this (for you):","resources edit","We already covered the title, tags and content part - they are the same as with the todo/preboarding items. Something new here is the 'Chapters' part. The name already gives it away, you can create chapters in these resources. This comes in handy when you want to split information a bit more (in the event that headers aren't enough). By default, you can't really check if the new hire indeed read/understood what was in the chapter. To solve that, you could turn the resource into a course (see the switch 'Is a course item'). If you enable that, your new hire will have to go through the resource chapter by chapter. You could also add questions in between the chapters, so you can check their knowledge. You will be able to see the answer that they filled in on your side. The chapter with a question mark icon before it are these test. They can only consist of multiple choice questions. You can also pick or create a category to separate the multiple resources for your new hire."]},{"l":"Introduction items","p":["Your new hire is new to the company and they barely know anyone. Perhaps they know a few people through the interviews, but that's most likely it. Introduction items are items that introduce your colleagues to your new hire. They look like this for you:","introduction edit","On the right side, you have an example of how it looks for your new hire (in the webportal). Please note that items within the curly brackets, those will be replaced with the new hire's first name. This goes for most fields in the software (including content and title items). You can use these placeholders (within curly brackets):","first_name: new hire's first name","last_name: new hire's last name","email: new hire's email address","position: new hire's position","department: new hire's department (if any)","buddy: new hire's buddy's full name","buddy_email: new hire's buddy's email address","manager: new hire's manager's full name","manager_email: new hire's manager's email address"]},{"l":"Badge items","p":["Badges are a way to keep your new hire motivated. You can't really do much with a badge, it's just there to give your new hire that extra bit of positivity between going through all the boring tasks they need to complete.","badge edit"]},{"l":"Admin to do items","p":["Sometimes, you or any of your colleagues need to do something for your new hire as well. With these items, you can automatically create a to do item for someone. You can assign it to someone and you can also notify someone else of this.","admin todo edit","They will get a notification of this through Slack or email."]},{"i":"textslackemail-messages","l":"Text/Slack/Email messages","p":["I am going over those all at once as they all have the same purpose: Sending a one-off message to someone. This 'someone' could be the new hire themselves, the manager or buddy assigned to the new hire or some random person that you can pick yourself (or in the case of Slack; a channel is possible as well).","Here is an example of an email message:","admin todo edit","Here is how the bottom part of our sequence looks like now. Now, this is only a really small sequence and you can make those as large as you want. You could also stack them - adding multiple sequences to one new hire.","sequence end"]},{"l":"People","p":["Everyone that is in ChiefOnboarding is listed under 'People' -> 'Employees'.

They can create new hires, remove them, create sequences and templates and so on.

They have access to their new hire's (being the manager), the templates/sequences and their admin to do items. They will NOT have access to settings items."]},{"l":"Employees","p":["Employees are basically empty accounts. They don't do much by default. They will show up on the colleagues page, but that's basically it. You can import them from Slack to quickly have them all listed here.","If you want, you can assign resources to these people and then they will be able to use the Slack bot and online webportal too look into these. Resources don't have to be just for new hires - they can be useful for long time employees as well.

For object creation, it uses factoryboy. You will find factories.py in almost every app.","It relies heavily on background tasks. You can find those tasks in the tasks.py files in the apps folders. Especially the Slack bot and the Sequence s use those a lot.","Supervisord is set up for docker-compose. It will run two processes: the background worker ( Django-Q) and python manage.py runserver for the server.","Sequences are basically blueprints for new hires. The Condition s that are in there are all connected to the Sequence. Once a sequence gets assigned to a new hire, it will duplicate the Condition and assign it directly to the User model. This means that if an admin would change a Condition in a Sequence, then that won't affect new hires that are currently going through sequences. There is one caveat with that though: if a template gets changes (i.e. a to do item or resource), then that will reflect for all people that don't have a custom one.
