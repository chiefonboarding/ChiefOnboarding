# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to ChiefOnboarding! Regardless if it's a typo fix, some translations or a huge feature, your help is always appreciated!

Following these guidelines is important to show that you respect the time of the developers maintaining this open source project. In return, we will help you with finalizing your pull requests.

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials, submitting bug reports are all examples of helpful contributions.

# Ground Rules
You have to follow the rules explained in the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

# Your First Contribution
If you are unsure where to begin contributing to ChiefOnboarding? You can start by looking through these [beginner and help-wanted issues](https://github.com/chiefonboarding/ChiefOnboarding/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Generally, these are fairly straightforward to fix and we will want the PR for it, so you are sure that it will be merged when we approve the changes. If you need help, then you are free to ask in the issue. Generally, these issues are fairly well explained. Though, you will need to know the basics of Django to be able to complete them.


# Getting started
Please read the [ARCHITECT.md](ARCHITECT.md) file first to get a sense of how ChiefOnboarding is set up.

For something that is bigger than a few lines of code changes:

1. Create your own fork of the repository
2. Make the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
   * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. We use isort, black and flake8 (in that order) to check.
   * Run the test suite to make sure it didn't break anything. If it's a bigger change, then please also write some tests for it. If you don't want or can't do this, then let it know in the PR and one of the devs might be able to pick that up for you.
   * Note the Code of Conduct.
   * Send a pull request 

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Read [SECURITY.md] for more info on how to report those.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. Are you on the latest version of ChiefOnboarding? We only give support for version 2.x.
2. What browser are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
ChiefOnboarding is build in a way that makes it fairly easy to extend, for example with the integrations/webooks, you can add config that allows you to tailer it to your needs. We would like to keep that philosophy with every feature that we add. This doesn't mean that everything should be expandable in way, but we should avoid things that would lock us in. When you submit the request for a new feature, try to think of how we could extend it to other areas or make it more generic.

In the issue, please tell us what you want and why you want it. The "why" helps us better understand how you use ChiefOnboarding.

# Code review process
One of the ChiefOnboarding maintainers will review your pull request and potentially request changes. Don't hesitate to ask questions if things are not clear. Once we are happy with the PR, then we will merge it. We don't like large backlogs of PRs, so you can expect quick merges, once things are approved. 

If you, for any reason, are not able to complete the PR, then let us know and we will likely take it over from you. On the other side, if you fail to respond within a reasonable time, then we will either close your PR or pick it up where you left. No hard feelings, we know life can get in the way. We will always let you know when we do.

# Community
Most of the community for this app will be on Github, though, we also have [integrations.chiefonboarding.com](https://integrations.chiefonboarding.com), where people can share their integration configs. You are free to join there as well.
