## Pricing

ChiefOnboarding is free and open source software (FOSS), and it's therefore free to use, but comes as is with no guaranteed support if you would run into any issues. To keep things sustainable, we do provide support contracts and custom feature building. Need something very specific or have a specific user case? Then we can add it!

Pricing support package: **249 euro/month** (excl VAT if applicable). This gets you full priority email support from a team member (a core developer) - best effort, but generally under 2 hours response time.

If you need a **custom feature**, then please reach out to use through <a href="mailto:hello@chiefonboarding.com">hello@chiefonboarding.com</a> and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
