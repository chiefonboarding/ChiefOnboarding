## Features
- **Automatically provision user accounts and trigger webhooks**, see [https://integrations.chiefonboarding.com](https://integrations.chiefonboarding.com) for a list of integrations or create your own!
- **Pre-boarding**: onboarding doesn't start on day 1, it starts before that. Build pre-boarding pages to welcome new hires before they start.
- **To do items**: keep track of the things that your new hires need to do and allow them to fill in forms.
- **Resources**: let them search through the knowledge base and complete courses so they are quickly up to speed with colleagues.
- **Sequences**: drip feeding items over time or based on the completion of a to do item. Avoid the overwhelming feeling.  
- **Badges**: reward new hires for the things they have done. This also helps to keep them motivated.
- **Introductions**: introduce people to new hires.
- **Admin to do items**: collaborate with colleagues on things that need to be done for the new hire.
- **Multilingual**: English, Dutch, Portuguese, German, Turkey, French, Spanish, and Japanese are all supported. Need another language? Send us an [email](mailto:hell@chiefonboarding.com)!
- **Timezones**: It doesn't matter where your new hire lives. You can adjust the timezone per new hire, so they don't get messages in the middle of the night!
- **Slack bot and dashboard**: your new hires can use the dashboard or the Slack bot. Both provide all features and can be used standalone.
- **Customizable**: use your logo, add your color scheme, change the email template and even customize the bot to your liking. No one will know you are using ChiefOnboarding.
- **Transparency, freedom, and privacy**: ChiefOnboarding is completely open-source and licensed under AGPLv3.
- Host it yourself on your own infrastructure or [let us host it for you](https://chiefonboarding.com/pricing)!
